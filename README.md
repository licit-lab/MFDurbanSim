# MFDurbanSim

A MFD-based urban traffic simulator

**Description**

MFDurbanSim is a traffic simulator for modeling regional urban traffic dynamics in a large metropolitan area. It is based on the concept of the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) that relates the vehicle space-mean speed to the density of vehicles traveling in an urban region. Unlike classical microscopic traffic simulation, this approach describes traffic states at an aggregate level: the individual position and speed of vehicles are not known, only their current regional location and the regional mean speed shared by all vehicles traveling in the same region.

This simulator is a Python extension of the [SymuRes platform](https://github.com/Ifsttar/SymuRes) developed by Guilhem Mariotte during his PhD.
